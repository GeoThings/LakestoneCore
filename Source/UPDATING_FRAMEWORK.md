// whenever the lakestonecore is updated,
// it needs to be rebuilt (clean first) and added to the kit

// pressing build will activate the script of building for the simulator
// pressing archive will activate the script of building for the device

// the script automatically copies .framework files into ../GeoBingAnKit/Frameworks/{Debug,Release}
// but if the project is in another folder those have to be copied(replaced) manually

// bulding the geobingankit will cause the framework to be copied to 'Active' automatically
